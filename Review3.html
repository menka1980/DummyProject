<p> Both can be great, depending on the site.I think liquid design works best when you have lots of content, since it allows you to use as much real estate as possible.A style of Web page layout, meaning the layout is entirely flexible, filling the browser window as it expands or contracts. Ice design can be useful for sites that don't have as much content, or for sites where design perfection is an important factor.The fixed-width sites sitting all the way on the left side of the browser screen, with an ocean of blank white space filling up the other half of the screen.. </P>
